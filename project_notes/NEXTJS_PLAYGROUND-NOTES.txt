I’m planning to build a Next.js app called “Next.js Playground.” The goal of this app is to help users better understand Next.js fundamentals by showcasing its architecture, demos, and real-world codebases. It’s designed to simplify learning and bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation.

I’m planning to build a Next.js app called “Next.js Playground.” The goal of this app is to help users better understand Next.js fundamentals by showcasing its architecture, demos, and real-world codebases. It’s designed to simplify learning and bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation. so give me a very complete fullstack feature overview  and lists on it , my tech stacks are (nextjs(app router 15.3.2), supabase, tailwind, better auth and etc)

#  * Next.js Playground Color Theme
🎨 Backup Dual-Mode Color Theme (Dark + Light)
    (Element)                         	        (Dark Mode)	                                            (Light Mode)
Primary Background              	#0B0F19 (dark navy)	                        #F9FAFB (almost white, very light gray)
Surface / Card BG               	#151B2B (blue-gray)                            #FFFFFF (pure white)
Primary Text                    	#E4E4E7 (cool light gray)                     	#111827 (almost black)
Secondary Text                  	#9CA3AF (cool gray)	                        #4B5563 (gray 700)
Accent Color                    	#7F5AF0 (electric purple)                   	#7F5AF0 (same, carries across modes)
Secondary Accent                	#0EA5E9 (cyan) or #FF6AC1 (pink)             #0EA5E9 (cyan) or #FF6AC1 (pink)
Border / Divider                	#1E293B (slate)	                            #E5E7EB (gray 200)
Link / Interactive              	#38BDF8 (sky blue)                             #2563EB (blue 600)
Error / Warning                  	#F43F5E (rose red) or #FAC

C15 (amber)	        Same

💡 Design Tips

• Keep accent colors consistent across both modes for brand identity.
• Adjust background + text contrast carefully (especially gray tones) to ensure readability.
• Use shadows subtly in light mode, and more contrast/outline effects in dark mode.
• In Tailwind or CSS, set up variables or use dark: classes for smooth toggling.

# * 📂 File & folder naming
✅ kebab-case → for folders, page files, and components inside app/ or pages/:

/app/api-service
/app/authentication-system
/styles/main-header.module.css

# ? when to use kebab-case?
URLs match folder names → /api-service becomes /api-service
Consistency across file systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)
Easier to scan and type in terminal

💻 Component & file names (React components)
✅ PascalCase → for React component files and their filenames:

/components/Navbar.tsx
/components/AuthForm.tsx


# ? when to use PascalCase?
Matches React convention → components start with capital letters
Clear separation between components and utility/helper files

⚙ Helper files, utilities
✅ camelCase or kebab-case → for non-component files like utils, hooks, or config:

/utils/formatDate.ts
/hooks/useAuth.ts
/config/apiConfig.ts

# ? when to use camelCase or kebab-case?
camelCase matches function naming
kebab-case is fine too for folder or filename consistency

🌎 Public assets (images, files)
✅ kebab-case → for anything in /public

/public/logo-dark.png
/public/user-avatar.svg
/public/favicon.ico
/public/styles/global.css

# ? when to use kebab-case for public assets?
Web-safe, avoids case problems in URLs
Easy to manage in static folders

🔑 Summary (Next.js naming guide)
        (Type)	                        (Naming style)  
Folders + page files	            kebab-case
React components	                PascalCase
Utilities, hooks	                camelCase or kebab-case
Public assets	                    kebab-case
}

{
    # * 📂 Folder naming best practices
✅ Use kebab-case
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
/app/api-service
/app/authentication-system
/components/shared-ui
/hooks/use-auth
/utils/api-client

# ? Why kebab-case?
Avoids spaces → no issues on different OSes
Avoids uppercase → no case sensitivity surprises (especially on Linux)
Easy to type in terminal and URLs

Matches how URLs are typically written (lowercase with dashes)

🚨 Avoid
❌ PascalCase folders → might look nice but leads to mixed casing issues
❌ camelCase folders → uncommon for folders, harder to scan visually
❌ snake_case → mostly used in backend or Python, feels out of place in Next.js/web projects

# * 🗂 Folder naming by type
    (Folder type)	                (Example name)
Feature folders	            /app/api-service
Component groups            /components/form-elements
Hooks	                    /hooks/use-auth
Utilities	                /utils/date-helpers
Styles	                    /styles/global-styles
Public assets	            /public/user-avatars
