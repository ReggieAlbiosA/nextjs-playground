## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Configure Git (Global Settings)

```bash
# Set your GitHub user info
git config --global user.name "yourgitaccountname"
git config --global user.email "yourgitaccountemail"

# (Optional) Set default branch name (instead of 'main')
git config --global init.defaultBranch dev
```

---

## üì¶ Step 2: Initialize Local Repository

```bash
# Initialize Git repository in project folder
git init

# Check branch and file status
git status
```

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Step 3: Track and Commit Changes

```bash
# Track all changes
git add .

# Or track a specific file/folder
git add folder/file

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# View commit history
git log
```

---

## üîÄ Step 4: Branching Strategies and Management

Branches are essential for isolating development work, fixing bugs, or experimenting without affecting the main codebase (e.g., `main` or `dev` branch).

### Creating and Switching Branches

```bash
# List all local branches (current branch is marked with *)
git branch

# List all remote branches
git branch -r

# List all local and remote branches
git branch -a

# Create a new branch based on your current branch
git branch <new-branch-name>

# Switch to an existing branch
git checkout <existing-branch-name>
# This updates your working directory to reflect the state of that branch.

# Create a new branch AND switch to it immediately
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
# Equivalent to:
# git branch <new-branch-name>
# git checkout <new-branch-name>

# Create a new branch from a specific existing branch and switch to it
git checkout -b <new-branch-name> <existing-branch-name>

# Create a new branch pointing to a specific commit
git branch <new-branch-name> <commit_hash>

# Switch back to the default branch (e.g., 'main')
git checkout main

# Force switch to a branch and discard local changes (Use with caution!)
git checkout -f main
```

### Deleting Branches

```bash
# Delete a local branch (only if it's fully merged into HEAD)
git branch -d <branch-name>

# Force delete a local branch (even if not merged - potential data loss!)
git branch -D <branch-name>

# Delete a remote branch
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
# Or: git push origin :<branch-name> (older syntax)
```

### Renaming Branches

```bash
# Rename the current local branch
git branch -m <new-branch-name>

# Rename a different local branch
git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>

# To "rename" a remote branch, you typically:
# 1. Rename the local branch.
# 2. Push the new local branch to the remote.
# 3. Delete the old remote branch.
# git push origin -u <new-branch-name>
# git push origin --delete <old-branch-name>
```

---

## üßê Step 5: Working with Commits (Advanced)

Beyond just creating commits, Git offers powerful ways to manage and modify them.

### Viewing Commit History

```bash
# View commit history (shows hash, author, date, message)
git log

# View history with more detail (patches introduced)
git log -p

# View history in a compact, one-line format with graph
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all

# View history for a specific file
git log <file-path>

# View history since a specific date
git log --since="2 weeks ago"

# Switch to a previous commit (Detached HEAD state - for inspection)
git checkout <commit_hash>
# To go back to your branch: git checkout <branch-name>
```

### Amending the Last Commit

If you made a mistake in your last commit message or forgot to add a file:

```bash
# Add any missed files
git add <missed-file>

# Amend the previous commit (opens editor for message change)
git commit --amend

# Amend with a new message directly
git commit --amend -m "New corrected commit message"
# Caution: Only amend commits that haven't been pushed to a shared remote.
# If pushed, it rewrites history and can cause issues for collaborators.
```

### Reverting Commits

To undo a commit by creating a new commit that reverses its changes:

```bash
# Revert a specific commit (creates a new commit undoing the changes)
git revert <commit_hash>
# This is safe for shared history as it doesn't rewrite it.
# Git will open an editor for the revert commit message.
```

### Resetting Commits (Use with Caution)

`git reset` moves the current branch tip, potentially discarding commits or changes.
**Be very careful with `git reset`, especially `--hard`, as it can lead to data loss.**

```bash
# Unstage a file (remove from staging area, keep changes in working directory)
git reset HEAD <file-name>

# Reset to a previous commit, keeping changes in working directory (unstaged)
# This is the default mode (mixed).
git reset <commit_hash>
# Or: git reset --mixed <commit_hash>

# Reset to a previous commit, keeping changes staged
git reset --soft <commit_hash>
# Useful for squashing commits or redoing commit structure.

# Reset to a previous commit, discarding all changes since (DANGEROUS)
git reset --hard <commit_hash>
# This will delete uncommitted changes and commits after <commit_hash> on this branch.
# Use only on local commits that haven't been pushed, or if you're sure.
```

## üåê Step 6: Create and Connect to GitHub Repository

1Ô∏è‚É£ **On GitHub:**

- Log in ‚Üí Click ‚ûï ‚Üí New repository
- Name: nextjs-playground (or your choice)
- Visibility: Public or Private
- ‚ö† Do NOT initialize with README
- Click **Create repository**

2Ô∏è‚É£ **In terminal:**

```bash
# Add remote repository (choose one)

# HTTPS
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/nextjs-playground.git

# SSH
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/nextjs-playground.git

# Rename branch if needed
git branch -M main

# Push local commits to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

---

## üîÑ Step 7: Syncing Changes

```bash
# Pull latest updates
git pull origin main

# Push new commits
git push
```

---

## Working on Branching

```bash


# Switching to a specific branch (existing or new)
git checkout <existing-or-new-branch>
# If the branch exists, this switches your working directory to it.
# If the branch does not exist, this command will fail (unless you use -b to create).

# Going to the default branch (usually 'main' or 'master')
git checkout main
# Switches your working directory back to the default branch named 'main'.
# Replace 'main' with your default branch name if different (e.g., 'master').

# Creating a new branch and switching to it immediately
git checkout -b <new-branch>
# Creates a new branch called <new-branch> based on your current branch,
# and switches your working directory to this new branch.

# Creating a new branch pointing to a specific existing branch (without switching)
git branch <new-branch-name> <existing-branch-name>
# Creates a new branch called <new-branch-name> that points to the same commit as <existing-branch-name>.
# Your working directory remains on the current branch (no switch occurs).

# Creating a new branch from a specific existing branch and switching to it immediately
git checkout -b <new-branch-name> <existing-branch-name>
# Creates a new branch called <new-branch-name> starting from <existing-branch-name>,
# then switches your working directory to this new branch.


```

## üóÇ Repository Types Overview

| Local Repository           | Remote Repository (GitHub)          |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| On your machine            | On GitHub cloud                     |
| Private (by default)       | Shareable with collaborators        |
| Use `git` commands locally | Use `git push` / `git pull` to sync |
